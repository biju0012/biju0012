    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
     <P>
IM AMAL BIJU,A 19 YEAR OLD ALGONQUIN STUDENT FROM KERALA,INDIA. I AM A VERY PASSIONATE PERSON WHO LOVES TO DO EXCITING THINGS EVERYDAY. I COMPLETED MY HIGH IN DON BOSCO HIGHER SECONDARY SCHOOL IN MY HOME COUNTRY IN 2021.
I ALWAYS HAD A CURIOSITY TO EXPLORE THE VAST CULTURES AND COUNTRIES OF THIS AMAZING PLANET SO, I THOUGHT OF HAVING MY FUTURE STUDIES IN CANADA. AFTER A LONG TIME OF RESEARCHING I FOUND THE PERFECT AND MOST SUITABLE
 COLLEGE FOR ME IT WAS ,ALGONQUIN COLLEGE IN OTTAWA.
